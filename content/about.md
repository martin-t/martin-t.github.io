Focusing on the good parts of rationalism like thinking logically and overcoming biases, not on the bad parts like being a cult, or the boring parts like A"I"/ML.

Currently, I am interested in programming languages and learning ones that are less bad than others - hence my interest in Rust - for many tasks it's the least bad language I know of. Some people think I am saying it's good. I am not. It's not. It has a bunch of issues limiting its potential which is something I plan to write about too, even if some parts of the Rust community are very hostile to criticism. You can't have improvements withough admitting flaws first.

The other interest I plan to cover here is gamedev. Right now I am working on two games in Rust, something that made me open my eyes to Rust's flaws, and it might be time to stop talking about writing a devlog and start writing the devlog.
