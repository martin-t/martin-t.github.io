Every dead blog seems to have a last post explaining that the author is not dead (yet) and about to resume regular blogging any minute now. I can do better; I'll start with one.

I plan to write mostly about technical topics - Rust, programming in general, gamedev, and maybe a bit about the FOSS movement. I'd like to write about some non-technical topics too, but the internet is full of crazy people and, worse, some who are not crazy...

Currently, I am interested in programming languages and learning ones that are less bad than others - hence my interest in Rust - it's the least bad language[^least-bad] I know. Some people think I am saying it's good. I am not. It's not. It has a bunch of issues limiting its potential which is something I plan to write about too, even if some parts of the Rust community are very hostile to criticism. You can't have improvements withough admitting flaws first.

[^least-bad]: For most purposes.

The other interest I plan to cover here is gamedev. Right now I am working on two games in Rust, something that made me open my eyes to Rust's flaws, and it might be time to stop talking about writing a devlog and start writing the devlog.

Oh and there's gonna be rants. Software is broken and everything else too. There's way too many people who have no clue what they're doing, way too many who think they know everything, and far too few who are actually competent but open to being wrong.

Finally, if you've reached this post by scrolling past dozens or hundreds of others written over the course of a decade, then, first, good job myself; and second, please, keep in mind people change their opinions[^opinions]. And don't take everything too seriously, the goal of writing is to make people (and myself) think, not to dispense absolute truth.

[^opinions]: Or simply `s/their opinions//`.
