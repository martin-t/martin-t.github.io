Every abandoned blog seems to have a last post explaining that the author is not dead (yet) and about to resume regular blogging any minute now. I can do better; I'll start with that post.

Anyway, I plan to write mostly about technical topics - Rust, programming in general, gamedev, and maybe a bit about FOSS.

Oh and there's gonna be rants. Software is broken and everything else too. There's way too many people who have no clue what they're doing, way too many who think they know everything, and far too few who are actually competent and reasonable.

Finally, if you've reached this post by scrolling past dozens or hundreds of others written over the course of a decade, then, first, good job myself; and second, please, keep in mind people change their opinions[^opinions]. And don't take everything too seriously, the goal of writing is to make people (and myself) think, not to dispense absolute truth.

[^opinions]: Or simply `s/their opinions//`.
